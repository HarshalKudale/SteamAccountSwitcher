# SteamAccountSwitcher
Switch between 2 steam accounts just by opening a file.

First Login to both accounts one by one while selecting remember password.
Edit the bat file for both usernames at start like
``username=john101``
and
``username2=doe101``


Just open the file when you need to switch account.
